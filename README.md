# To-Do-List-version2.0
This time, added the functionality of remote database using MongoDB and mongoose. Thus, these are the technologies that are used in building this webApp= NodeJS, ExpressJS, EJS, MongoDB, and Mongoose

Right Now- There's a bug/error stating "Duplicate key error" for the item of the custom lists(/lists/work,/lists/school). After '/lists/work' if you create any other list (eg:- /lists/school)
then the server won't respond because of the error- "Duplicate key error" for the starting 03 itmes that addded in every list (welcome.., add.., remove...).
